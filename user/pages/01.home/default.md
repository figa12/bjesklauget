# Welcome to Bjesklauget

## The Esteemed Society for Bjesk Enthusiasts

Bjesklauget is a private club dedicated to the art and enjoyment of crafting and tasting traditional Danish bjesk (herb-infused schnapps). We gather twice a year for our cherished Spring and Fall events, sharing camaraderie, good food, and of course, exceptional bjesk.
